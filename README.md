# Bitcoin Time Series Prediction with LSTM

## Overview
This project leverages a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network to predict Bitcoin market prices. Using historical data, the model is trained to forecast future values, showcasing the power of LSTM in handling time series data.

## Dataset
Utilizes 838 days of Bitcoin price data (from January 1, 2017, to April 30, 2019), highlighting the volatility and trend patterns of Bitcoin.

## Features
- **Data Processing:** In-depth normalization and preparation of time series data.
- **LSTM Network:** Custom-built LSTM model for time series prediction.
- **Model Training & Validation:** Rigorous training and testing to ensure accuracy.
- **Forecasting Interface:** Interactive prediction of future Bitcoin values based on user input.

## File Structure
- `final.py`: Core script for running the LSTM model.
- `bitcoin-time-series-prediction-with-lstm.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for detailed implementation, analysis, and visualization.
- `/data`: Directory containing historical Bitcoin data.

## Installation & Usage
